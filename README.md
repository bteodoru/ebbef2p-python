## Background

The computer program EBBEF2p was originally written as a toolbox for the MATLAB computing environment. EBBEF2p (Euler-Bernoulli Beams on Two-Parameter Elastic Foundationis) can handle a wide range of static loading problems involving one-dimensional beams supported by elastic foundation.

## Why EBBEF2p for Python?
Matlab is a quite expensive comercial product, which means that code that is written in Matlab can only be used by people with sufficient funds to buy a license. Unlike MATLAB, Python is free to use and distribute both for personal and commercial use.
